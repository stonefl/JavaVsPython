    "As a developer, I have used both Java and Python for a while. There are many [debates about Java/Python productivity](https://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/2009/10/03/python-java-a-side-by-side-comparison/), but I will not discuss the issue here. In my opionion, as a good developer you should choose the best programming language based on the type of project you are working on. In order to make a decision, you should learn and know the features of both language. I would like to present a list of side-by-side comparisons the features of Python and Java, but it is hard to make a complete list, thus I make the list into a series of posts. This list by no means to be exhaustive, just representative.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first post, I want to start with **String**, because it is a kind of _special_ object in both languages. Generally, a string is a sequence of characters, which can be indexed and concatenated. But unlike other `sequence` class, like list or array, in both languages, string is considered as immutableobject, which means it is constant and can cannot be changed once it has been created. "
